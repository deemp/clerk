# FAQ
There is a full latex template for your annotation work. It can be imported to Overleaf or used offline. Before the start, you should replace the stub title on the real one.

## How to replace the title page on the real one
1. Open needed docx template (folder "title"/<your department or bach if bachelor student>_annotation.docx).
2. Put Thesis topic and your name in appropriate places on Russian language.
3. Put the current year (last row).
4. Convert it to "title_annotation.pdf," replace the existing one in the root folder.
