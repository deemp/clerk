# FAQ
There is a full latex template for your thesis work. It can be imported to Overleaf or used offline. Before the start, you should replace the stub title on the real one.

## How to replace the title page on the real one
1. Open needed Docx template (folder "title"/<your department or bach if bachelor student>.docx).
2. Put the Thesis topic, supervisor's and your name in appropriate places on both English and Russian languages.
3. Put the current year (last row).
4. Convert it to "title.pdf," replace the existing one in the root folder.
